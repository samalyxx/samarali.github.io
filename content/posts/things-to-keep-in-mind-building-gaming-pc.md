Are you looking to build your own gaming PC? If so, you're in the right place! In this step-by-step guide, we will walk you through everything you need to know in order to put together your very own gaming computer. We'll provide a parts list and show you how much each component costs, so you can budget accordingly. Plus, we'll give you some tips on how to choose the best parts for your needs. So what are you waiting for? Let's get started!


First things first: you need parts! Before starting any build, make sure that all parts are compatible with one another. This is the most important step in assembling your new gaming computer because without proper compatibility nothing will work correctly (or at all). Once everything has been confirmed as compatible, choose a case for housing all of these parts. 



# Which Gaming Cases Are Best? 

Cases and parts like CPU cooler, fans and liquid coolers depend on the budget of your build. You can choose according to your choice as well. Good options are `Cooler Master MasterBox MB311L RGB Airflow ATX Mid-Tower Gaming Case, Thermaltake Versa N21 Black SP`

# Which Motherboard You Should Buy? 

Now that you have a case picked out, it's time to choose a motherboard. Motherboards are an essential part of any build - they act as the central hub for all other parts. Make sure to pick one that is compatible with the CPU, RAM, and graphics card you plan on using. You'll also want to consider the number of ports available on the motherboard, as this will determine how many devices (such as USB sticks or hard drives) can be connected at once. `Overclocked` Motherboards are also a great option for those who want to push their PC's performance even further. Motherboards are dependent on the generations of CPUs. You have to install it according to your CPUs.

# Which CPU AMD vs Intel? 

CPUs are another important component in any gaming PC. The type of CPU you choose will determine the type of graphics card you can use, so it's important to do your research. AMD and Intel are the two main CPU manufacturers, and each has its own set of pros and cons. Today AMD has much more `cache` and `cores` than Intel, so for gaming purposes Intel CPUs are a better option. However, if you're looking to do some serious video or photo editing, then AMD would be the better choice.

# Which RAM Should You Install? 

RAM is another essential part of any build - especially for gaming computers. The more RAM your computer has, the better performance you'll get in games. RAM is measured in gigabytes (GB), and most gaming PCs have at least 16 GB of RAM. If you're looking to play graphically intensive games like The Witcher III or Grand Theft Auto V, then it's recommended that you go with 32 GB instead. Ram can also be overclocked to give you a small performance boost.  It also depends on your motherboard. Overclocking is often thought of in the context of a CPU or GPU, but you can also overclock RAM (random access memory) to achieve faster speeds. The speed of RAM, measured in MHz, refers to its data transfer rate. The faster the data transfer rate, the better the RAM's performance.Gskills , Corsair ram is also good options. Ram depends on `bus speed` and `CAS latency`.

# Does Power Supply Unit Play Important Role?
Power Supply Unit (PSU) is another important component in any gaming PC. The type of PSU you choose will determine the type of graphics card you can use, so it's important to do your research. Crosair, SeaSonic, and EVGA are some of the best PSU manufacturers on the market. These usually have labels such as 80+ with some sort of naming afterward for certification. `The most common are 80+, 80+ bronze, gold, and silver.`


# Hearts Of Gamers GPU.
Graphics cards are a crucial part of any gaming PC. Not only do they affect the graphical quality of games, but they also play a major role in overall performance. When choosing a graphics card, you'll want to consider two things: your budget and the type of games you plan on playing. If you're looking to play high-end games on max settings, then you'll need a graphics card that is more expensive. `Geforce GTX 1070, GTX 1080` are good examples. However, if you're on a tighter budget, then you can opt for a less expensive card that will still give you decent performance. Top-performing fragments `are 3090 TI 3070` etc. Where as on AMD  side it’s Radeon RX 6900 XT.

# Storage 
Storage is another important factor to consider when building a gaming PC. The more storage your computer has, the more games you'll be able to install at once. Gaming PCs usually have two storage options: a hard drive and a solid-state drive. A hard drive is a traditional storage option that is cheaper but offers slower. M.2 NVME SSDs are better than SATA SSDs because they have faster read/write speeds and a smaller footprint. If you don't want to spend too much money on storage, then a hard drive is the best way to go.

# Thermal Paste
Thermal paste! This is a substance that helps transfer heat from the CPU to the cooler, and it's a must-have for any gaming build. Thermal paste comes included with most CPU coolers, but if it doesn't or you're using an aftermarket cooler, then be sure to pick some up separately. `ProlimaTech PK-3 Nano Aluminum, Arctic MX-5. Best Premium Thermal Paste.`

# Keeping Your Rig Cool 
Fans in gaming PCs are important. You want to have enough cooling so that your parts don’t overheat, but you also don’t want too many fans running and making noise. Most cases come with at least one pre-installed fan, but it's a good idea to buy a few extras if you're building a high-end gaming PC. Corsair, be quiet! and NZXT is some good fan brands to look for.

So, there you have it. These are the most important factors to consider when building a gaming PC. If you want to make sure your computer can handle all the latest games, then make sure to include these components in your build. And don't forget thermal paste! It's an essential part of any gaming PC and is often overlooked. What other questions do you have about building a gaming PC? Leave them in the comments below and we'll answer them as best we can.
