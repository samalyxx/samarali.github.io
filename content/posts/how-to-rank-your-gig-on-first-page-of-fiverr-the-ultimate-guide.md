### What is an Inspect element or Developer Tools? 

Modern web browsers have built-in tools that allow developers to debug errors in their code. Inspect Element allows developers or QAs to view and manipulate the appearance of a live web page by making temporary edits that can be used for experimenting with HTML, CSS & JavaScript. For instance when trying out new styles in your browser without actually changing any code you'll soon find yourself at an Inspect element where there are tools like Styles inspector which let's see what changes would happen if we added this style information into our own website!Below the attachment you can see an inspect example.

4. After that you have to click on the 3 dots that are on the right top as attached in the picture below. Click on the disable Popup Auto Hide. This would allow the popup/addon not to vanish after clicking on it. Its location would be fixed and you can easily inspect the element in that way. That's not all we have one more step pending.

5. After that a new window symbol just appears next to the 3 dots. You have you click that and like in my case I am selecting the /popover/popover.html . It would load all the elements and allow the user to unlock all the inspect feature. You can inspect check the consoles, Network, font styles, etc.
