# What is fiverr really? 

Fiverr is a virtual market where you can buy and sell services online. Everything revolves around the different price tag, as all gigs on Fiverr are offered for $5 each. You can order any service you need from graphic design to programming and even some questionable tasks such as "buying" Facebook fans or Twitter followers. 

All services are offered by freelancers from around the world and have been ranked up to 5 stars based on their clients' feedback. As a shopper, you can search for specific types of gigs, check out the highest rated sellers, view their ratings and reviews from previous buyers. 

As a Fiverr seller, you must first register as a seller at fiverr.com , which is free by the way, and then make a listing for your gig following Fiverr guidelines. Each gig has its own page where shoppers can look through your profile info and examples of past work before deciding whether to order from you or not. 

Every order that comes in will cost $5 to both parties involved – the buyer and the seller. Fiverr will also take 20% of this sum as a fee for being the middleman between both parties.

The main problem with Fiverr is that you will have to choose whether or not to take on work that isn't in your field, but I'll get back to that later… 

#  What are the benefits of selling on Fiverr? 

Fiverr gives freelancers an opportunity to earn money online without any fees involved. The low price tag attached to every gig provides buyers with cheap solutions for their needs while allowing sellers to make quick cash by providing quick services they can do through outsourcing. 

Fiverr is also perfect for beginners who are just starting out and testing the waters of freelancing. It helps you to get your start without having to spend a lot of money on initial fees or web design, which can be quite expensive nowadays. You get to hone your skills while getting real life experience by selling your completed work through Fiverr. 

#  How do I rank my gigs on fiverr ? 

If you're a Fiverr seller, you know that ranking your gig on the first page of search results is crucial to getting more orders. But what's the best way to do it? How can you make sure your gig appears above all the others? In this guide, we'll walk you through the three steps that Fiverr takes into account when ranking gigs: reviews, price and delivery time. We'll also give you some tips on how to boost your rankings and get more orders! 

#  Step One: Boost Your Reviews 

<InlineImage src="post/fiverr/img-is.png" alt="Pikachu waving!"></InlineImage>

The first thing that Fiverr looks at when ranking gigs is the number and quality of reviews. Sellers with more positive reviews will rank higher than those with fewer or negative reviews. So how can you make sure your gig gets more good reviews? Here are a few tips: 

1. Make sure your gig is high quality. Offer a great product or service and make sure your description is clear and accurate. 
2. Reply promptly to buyers' questions and requests.
3. Make sure you deliver on time, every time. 
4. Offer extras or add-ons to give buyers a better experience. 

#  Step Two: Keyword In Title

The title is one of the most important parts of the gig page, you should create a good title for your gig to make it more visible in search engines. 

The first thing about the title is that you have to choose the right keyword with low difficulty. if you want to rank your gig on the first page then you have to choose the main keyword which has lower difficulty because picking hard keywords will never work out. 

For example, if your gig is related to sports then try choosing " backlink service" as your main keyword which has high demand but low competition so it's easy to rank up on the first page. 

 To write a good title you must use these basic things : 
 1. Keyword In Title Of Gig 
 2. Targeting of your gig 
 3. Some attractive words

# Step Three : Add the right Keywords to Tags/Description 

As a common practice I try to add related keywords at the end of tags in my gig description

For example, when you sell book covers , you'll find that most gigs offer only a few variants: 

1. book cover design 
2. artwork for book covers 
3. custom book cover 

 This isn't wrong, but you can go further. 

What if someone searches for "book cover design with an engine"? Not many people do it now, but in time the search results will include that term more and more often.People always search for something specific. And that's your chance to appeal to them and convince them to buy through your gig. See? It's simple, quick and will give you more traffic. Don't forget to include your target keyword in the gig description to make sure that people find exactly what they are searching for! 

#  Step Four : Gig image guidelines

In business, image is everything—and first impressions count. When potential buyers see your Gig, its appeal is determined very quickly. If judged as “attractive,” buyers are more likely to click on it and spend more time exploring your service. Use Gig images that stand out to attract buyers and generate more revenue. In short, a great Gig image means more sales—so make the most of how your business presents itself in the marketplace using these Gig image guidelines. 

1280 x 769 px, with a minimum of 712 x 430 and a maximum of 4000 x 2416 px (at 72 DPI). Resizing images If you’re using a Mac, use Preview. On Windows, use Photo Gallery. Other free tools are available online.

Image quality Use sharp and clear images. Avoid pixelated, blurry, stretched, or “squashed” images. Use high-resolution, eye-catching images that stand out to potential buyers. Number of images per Gig You can upload up to 3 images—so make them count!

#  Step Five : Increase your conversion rate 

Now, let’s talk about increasing your conversion rate.

The first thing to understand is that the more you communicate with people, the higher will be your conversion rate. That means if you send messages every day or every other day to potential clients, inviting them to order from you, they are likely to do it sooner or later

In addition, your gig description is another way to convert potential clients into real ones. You know what I mean: quality pictures, as much information as possible and a clear call-to-action button. All of that helps a lot.

The more people see your gig, the more they will trust you and the higher will be your conversion rate. This is why it’s really important to make sure at least some people see your gigs. In addition, they must look at them from time to time, if not every single day. Everyone wants to get more business on Fiverr. However, most people don't know how they can get more customers to place orders with them. Today's global market is so competitive than ever before. It is not only about increasing your sales and revenue. It is about increasing your conversion rate.

  Here are few factors that influence your conversion rate in fiverr . 

  1. Clarity of your gig page 
  2. Users come to your gig with a particular mindset and want all the information they require to be available right there on the top. So, it is important that you don't need them to scroll down to get what they came for. You have limited time to capture their attention on your page.

  3. Keep the text short and crisp while making it informative. Avoid using unnecessary jargon or long sentences on your pages.
