        <h2>What is an Inspect elment or Developer Tools?</h2>
        <p>
          Modern web browsers have built-in tools that allow developers to debug
          errors in their code. Inspect Element allows developers or QAs to view
          and manipulate the appearance of a live web page by making temporary
          edits that can be used for experimenting with HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
          For instance when trying out new styles in your browser without
          actually changing any code you'll soon find yourself at an Inspect
          element where there are tools like Styles inspector which let's see
          what changes would happen if we added this style information into our
          own website!Below the attachment you can see an inspect example.

          Firefox has a great built-in tool for inspecting web pages â€“ the
          Inspector Element. This tool is incredibly helpful for troubleshooting
          problems with your website, and can also be used to inspect popups
          from Firefox WebExtensions <br />
          <br />Have you ever wondered how to inspect a Firefox WebExtension
          popup? In this blog post, we will show you how to do just that! We
          will also walk you through the steps of debugging a WebExtension
          popup. So, if you are interested in learning more about inspecting and
          debugging Firefox WebExtensions, read on!
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Click the firefox setting and click down the extension as shown in
            this attachment below, then go to debug add-ons from within your
            browser menu at the top right corner where it says "more."
          </li>
          <br />
          <div class="featured-image">
            <img src="/assets/img/blog/well.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <br />
          <li>
            It's time to start exploring your newfound powers. The debug addon
            will give you a behind-the-scenes look at what is going on with
            firefox addons, and how they work! First click "Debug", then select
            an extension - in this case, we'll investigate Honey because it
            sounds delicious...I hope everyone knows about AliExpress, Fiverr,
            etc. It provides you with coupon of Ecommerce - websites. Click
            inspect if interested because this is where we get ready!
          </li>
          <br />
          <div class="featured-image">
            <img src="/assets/img/blog/1 ss.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <li>
            After clicking on the inspect a new page would be open and you have
            to click on the extension which you want to inspect. I clicked
            on the honey addon again.
          </li>
          <br />
          <div class="featured-image">
            <img src="/assets/img/blog/sss1.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <li>
            . After that you have to click on the 3 dots that are on the right
            top as attached in the picture below. Click on the disable Popup
            Auto Hide. This would allow the popup/addon not to vanish after
            clicking on it. Its location would be fixed and you can easily
            inspect the element in that way. That's not all we have one more
            step pending.
          </li>
          <br />
          <div class="featured-image">
            <img src="/assets/img/blog/ss2.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <li>
            After that a new window symbol just appears next to the 3 dots. You
            have you click that and like in my case I am selecting the
            /popover/popover.html . It would load all the elements and allow the
            user to unlock all the inspect feature. You can inspect check the
            consoles, Network, font styles, etc.
          </li>
          <br />
          <div class="featured-image">
            <img src="/assets/img/blog/ss3.png" alt="" />
          </div>
        </ol>
